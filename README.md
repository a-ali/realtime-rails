Realtime Support for Rails
====

Note: This gem is a concept piece originally conceived 2013 and published early 2014. As of mid-2015, support for performant, native and scalable websockets are available in Rails. See [ActiveCable](https://github.com/rails/actioncable) - you probably don't necessarily need a pub/sub server and Node.js running anymore to achieve similar lightweight realtime bi-directional communication with a large number of connected clients to your Rails application.
